## Features

You can find an overview and how to use video on the website.

* Create, upload and modify your creatures
* Import a [Dndbeyond encounter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounter-builder) into a bestiary, ready to print!
* Gather the creatures you need for a session in a bestiary
* Print minis for all the creatures in your bestiaries with a single click
* The Base color and shape can be customized
* Miniatures of the same type can be numbered
* The minis have a foldable base that can be reinforced with a coin to make them wind-resistant
* The optional name label on the miniature is sized to use all the space optimally
* The miniatures can be printed for 1-inch, 3/4-inch or 1/2-inch grids
* The height of the minis can be dynamically adjusted, based on creature size and source image
* You can adjust the brightness of the mini's backside to create a silhouette effect
* The minis are nicely arranged on a sheet in a way to minimize wasted space
