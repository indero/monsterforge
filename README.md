# Monsterforge

## About the project
The website at https://forge.dice.quest provides tools for tabletop gaming. 
The website is free and contains no ads.
Feel free to contribute anything from commenting to design or new options and tools. If you plan something bigger, please contact me beforehand.

### Fork?
The original project is at https://github.com/matnad/monsterforge, thanks to matnad for the initial work! I am still working on this project to make it slimmer and cleaner.

## Structure
The website is developed using the python framework django. I use the IDE PyCharm.
Refer to https://www.djangoproject.com/ for details about the directory structure and functions.
Using the provided venv is up to you. There is nothing special in it. Please always specify in your comments if you make changes to the venv!
